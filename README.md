# Vaccines and Adverse Reactions
## Data Overview
This project examined the adverse reactions by vaccine type from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System(VAERS), a CDC and FDA project used to monitor trends and detect problems
##
With the VAERS system there is limitations with the data sets which include but are not limited to, underreporting, reporting of adverse events even if cause is unclear and time series normalization for recent COVID-19 vaccine data
## Project Description
The study of this project was focused on adverse reactions by various vaccine types. Multiple analysis were conducted with the data to discern trends from the VAERS data set that would have meaningful implications. This included plotting adverse reaction data against Age data, Gender Data, Regional Data, Time series data, and Vaccine type data
